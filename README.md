# Background


A huge part of keeping a student organization on track is making
sure all of the moving pieces are going in the right direction. 
So far, Trello is a simple enough interface that it takes almost 
training to get someone up to speed (a huge plus for student 
organizations).

It can become a little hard to track tasks and projects over a whole student
organization, especially if the organization is split into multiple,
smaller committees. Many students are well-meaning individuals who are
a little inexperienced and need a little help keeping on task.

While Trello works within a single committee fairly well, it's hard to keep 
track of things when they're separated that way. 

# Solution

* Use Trello as the main operational tool for of our committees
* Create a single interface to __easily__ spot check and follow up with tasks/projects during meetings


# Implementation

* A simple webpage that uses the Trello javascript library to easily display currently 
active tasks from multiple boards at the same time.
